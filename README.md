## Inheritance

#### Develop a program based on the following description:

1. In a certain strategy game, there are `soldiers` and `heroes`. 
2. They all have a property containing a unique object number and a property that stores team membership. 
3. Soldiers have a method called `"follow the hero"`, which takes an object of type `"hero"` as an argument. 
4. Heroes have a method to increase their own level.

In the main branch of the program, one hero is created for each team. Soldier objects are generated in a loop. Their team membership is determined randomly. Soldiers from different teams are added to different lists.

The length of the lists of soldiers of opposing teams is measured and displayed on the screen. The hero belonging to the team with the longer list increases its level.

Send one of the soldiers of the first hero to follow him. Display the identification numbers of these two units on the screen.

#### Example of script implementation:

```python
Quantity soldiers of command A: 7.
Quantity soldiers of command B: 13.

The hero_1_B has leveled up to 1.

The soldier_7_A go to the hero_1_A. Global number of units: 21 and 1.
```
